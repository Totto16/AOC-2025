# AoC 2025
Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 repository! The solutions are written in Zig. The solutions aren't optimized for speed, more for readability.

## Running the solutions
For running the code you need [zig](https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/) >= 0.15.0.

Then you can use zig to compile and than execute the solutions


```bash
zig build
zig build test_day01 # or day<xx> or test_day<xx> etc.
```
